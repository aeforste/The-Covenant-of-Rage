# Travel Mechanics

When you undergo a long journey (2 or more nights), this is the procedure I will use:

1. Choose a route.
    * Identify number of days of travel
2. Begin travel day.
3. Decide **Danger Level (1-6)**, **Navigation DC**, and **Forage DC**. The players will not know these numbers, but they'll have an idea from research.
4. Identify navigator.
5. Set Pace:
    
    |   | Speed | Forage Bonus | Navigation Bonus | Perception/Stealth Bonus | Enemy Perception/Stealth Bonus | 
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |slow|2/3|0|+4|+4|-4|
    |medium|1|-4|0|0|0|
    |slow|1 1/3|no|-4|-4|+4|
    
6. Roll 6d6 for each phase of the day: morning, afternoon, evening, dusk, midnight, pre-dawn. If the dice reads the Danger Level or less, roll for an encounter.
7. Play out daytime encounters.
8. Navigator rolls against Navigation DC. Failure = LOST. Ranger in favored terrain gets advantage.
9. Everyone rolls against Forage DC. Failure = -1 ration.
    * For a natural 20, you forage enough food for two people.
    * For a ranger in their favored terrain, they get advantage and they can provide for two people.
10. Log progress (0 if LOST).
11. Play out nighttime encounters.
12. Go to step 2.

## Resources

Rations are a crucial resource. 1 day's rations costs 5sp (0.5gp), and you can only hold 3 days of food in your pack.
